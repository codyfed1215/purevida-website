  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "There is a one-time $99 installation fee. Beyond that, PureVida's full-service rental runs between $44 and $309 per month depending on what you need. PureVida typically bills quarterly."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included?",
    answer: "Everything. PureVida's full-service rental covers all parts, service, filters, and filter changes. If your system breaks, PureVida fixes it. If PureVida can't fix it, PureVida replaces it. PureVida also includes one free relocation per year. PureVida's industrial-grade filters are built to last, though PureVida changes them at least once a year to ensure peak performance. If you ever need anything, just reach out and PureVida will take care of it."
  },
  {
    question: "How does installation work?",
    answer: "PureVida's Field Technicians handle everything and installation can take as little as 45 minutes. You tell PureVida where you want the system, and PureVida runs flexible, durable, quarter-inch polyethylene lines from the back of the unit to an existing water source and drain in your building, similar to how data cabling runs through your facility. The water source and drain do not need to be near the system—only a power source does. PureVida uses push-to-connect fittings that piggyback off your existing plumbing. PureVida has thousands of systems installed across all types of buildings and environments."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the water really high quality?",
    answer: "Absolutely. PureVida takes any potable water source and transforms it into exceptional drinking water. Every system includes a sediment filter, two carbon filters, a reverse osmosis membrane, and automatic internal tank sanitization. PureVida also offers an optional \"Boost\" filter that adds back essential minerals and electrolytes while raising the pH. You'll taste the difference in your Free, No Obligations Trial."
  },
  {
    question: "What is my responsibility with the Coffee System?",
    answer: "PureVida handles installation and all service on your coffee system. Your company is responsible for sourcing and purchasing coffee beans and powders—there are hundreds of online and drop-ship options to fit any budget and preference, and PureVida will point you in the right direction for compatible powders. There is also a quick daily and weekly cleaning routine that takes just a few minutes. PureVida recommends designating a Coffee Liaison in your office, and the PureVida team will fully train and support them."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it a commitment?",
    answer: "Yes, and PureVida offers different commitment lengths to fit your needs. PureVida installs and maintains quality equipment at virtually no upfront cost—just the one-time $99 installation fee. In return, PureVida asks for a commitment. Most customers choose the longest term to lock in the lowest monthly rate. If your system ever breaks, PureVida fixes or replaces it at no charge. PureVida includes free relocations and lets you trial the system before you commit to or pay for anything. If you need to cancel early, you can pay off the remainder of your commitment and PureVida will pick up the equipment."
