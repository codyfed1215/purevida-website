  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "There is a one-time $99 installation fee. Beyond that, our full-service rental runs between $44 and $309 per month depending on what you need. We typically bill quarterly."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included?",
    answer: "Everything. Our full-service rental covers all parts, service, filters, and filter changes. If your system breaks, we fix it. If we can't fix it, we replace it. We also include one free relocation per year. Our industrial-grade filters are built to last, though we change them at least once a year to ensure peak performance. If you ever need anything, just reach out and we'll take care of it."
  },
  {
    question: "How does installation work?",
    answer: "Our Field Technicians handle everything and installation can take as little as 45 minutes. You tell us where you want the system, and we run flexible, durable, quarter-inch polyethylene lines from the back of the unit to an existing water source and drain in your building, similar to how data cabling runs through your facility. The water source and drain do not need to be near the system—only a power source does. We use push-to-connect fittings that piggyback off your existing plumbing. We have thousands of systems installed across all types of buildings and environments."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the water really high quality?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We take any potable water source and transform it into exceptional drinking water. Every system includes a sediment filter, two carbon filters, a reverse osmosis membrane, and automatic internal tank sanitization. We also offer an optional \"Boost\" filter that adds back essential minerals and electrolytes while raising the pH. You'll taste the difference in your Free, No Obligations Trial."
  },
  {
    question: "What is my responsibility with the Coffee System?",
    answer: "We handle installation and all service on your coffee system. Your company is responsible for sourcing and purchasing coffee beans and powders—there are hundreds of online and drop-ship options to fit any budget and preference, and we'll point you in the right direction for compatible powders. There is also a quick daily and weekly cleaning routine that takes just a few minutes. We recommend designating a Coffee Liaison in your office, and our team will fully train and support them."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it a commitment?",
    answer: "Yes, and we offer different commitment lengths to fit your needs. We install and maintain quality equipment at virtually no upfront cost—just the one-time $99 installation fee. In return, we ask for a commitment. Most customers choose the longest term to lock in the lowest monthly rate. If your system ever breaks, we fix or replace it at no charge. We include free relocations and let you trial the system before you commit to or pay for anything. If you need to cancel early, you can pay off the remainder of your commitment and we'll pick up our equipment."
