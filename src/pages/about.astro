  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "Our systems have a one-time, $99 installation fee. After that it is a full-service rental that ranges anywhere from $44 to $309 a month depending on what you need, but we typically bill quarterly."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included?",
    answer: "Our systems are on a full-service rental agreement which means if it ever breaks, we will fix it. If we cannot fix it, we will replace. All parts, service, filters and filter changes are included, and we will relocate the system for free once a year if needed. Our filters are industrial grade and will last for a long time. We do not like to let them go longer than a year without changing the filters. But if you ever need anything, you can reach out and we will get you fixed up."
  },
  {
    question: "How does installation work?",
    answer: "Our Field Technicians will come out, take your guidance, and install the equipment for you. Install can take as little as 45 minutes. You most likely have hundreds if not thousands of feet of data cabling and wiring running all through your facility now. Our process is similar to this. Tell us where you want it, then we will run our quarter inch, flexible but durable, polyethylene lines from the back of our systems to a water source and drain in your building. Water source and drain does not need to be close to the system. A power source does need to be close. We then use push to connect fittings that piggyback off the existing plumbing you already have in place. We have thousands of systems installed in all different types of buildings and environments."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the water really high quality?",
    answer: "Yes, this is wonderful water. We can take any potable water source, and turn it into outstanding water. A sediment filter, two carbon filters, a reverse osmosis membrane, an optional \"Boost\" filter that adds back in essential minerals, electrolytes, and boosts the PH of the water, auto internal tank sanitization. You will taste the difference in your Free, No Obligations Trial."
  },
  {
    question: "What is my responsibility with the Coffee System?",
    answer: "We will install and provide service on your coffee system. It will be up to your company to source and purchase the coffee beans and powders. There are hundreds of online and drop ship options for coffee beans based on your budget and your preference. We will point you in the right direction for what powders can work with the system. There is a very quick and simple daily and weekly upkeep process on the coffee system you will be responsible for that only takes minutes. It is best if you have an office manager or someone responsible that we can train on the quick processes that come along with the coffee system."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it a commitment?",
    answer: "Yes, it is a commitment, and we do offer different commitment lengths to fit your needs. We are installing and maintaining a nice piece of machinery at no real upfront cost to you, just the one-time $99 installation fee that goes to cover some of our installation costs. In return, we ask for a commitment. The majority of our customers go with the longest term so they can lock in the lowest possible monthly payment. Plus, if it ever breaks, we will fix it. If we cannot fix it, we will replace it. We offer free relocations. And we let you trial it before you ever commit to or pay for anything. If you need to cancel early, you can pay off the remainder of your commitment at that time and we will pick up our equipment."
